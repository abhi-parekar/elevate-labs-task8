# SQL Internship Task 8 - Stored Procedures and Functions

## 📌 Description
This task focuses on creating reusable SQL logic using stored procedures and functions. These objects encapsulate logic that can be reused with parameters for modular and secure query design.

## 💻 Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub for version control and submission
  
## 📂 Files Included
- **`stored_procs_and_funcs.sql`**: Contains definitions for:
  - Adding a new customer using a stored procedure
  - Counting total orders using a stored procedure
  - Calculating total payment using a function

- **`README.md`**: Documentation of the task logic and what was implemented.

## ✍️ What I Did
- Created stored procedures with input parameters for dynamic usage
- Implemented a reusable function to calculate total payment
- Demonstrated how to call both procedures and functions

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- `CREATE PROCEDURE` with `IN` parameters
- `CALL` syntax for procedures
- `CREATE FUNCTION` with `RETURN`
- Scalar function with aggregation logic
- `DELIMITER` management in MySQL

## 🔗 Submission
This GitHub repo contains the final task’s SQL definitions and usage examples for evaluation.
